The year is 2008. Ordering custom made PCB's is beginning to be a thing. [makepcb.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20080216163313/http://www.makepcb.com/) was the manufacturer I chose to have my first pcb professionally made. I paid â‚¬49.96 for 20 tiny boards.

The purpose of this pcb is to blink some LEDs to simulate some kind of pattern like policars, ambulances or broken fluorescent bulbs for the model railroad of the [Modulegroep BCN](https://web.archive.org/web/20160316101412/http://modulegroepbcn.nl/) club layout.

The brains is a ATTINY13.

This repository is a memory of the time that the Modulegroep BCN existed and the joy I had making my first PCB.

The files were made in [Eagle Cad 5.0.0](ftp://ftp.cadsoft.de/eagle/program/5.0) in a period Eagle was still owned by the [creators](https://web.archive.org/web/20080309165050/http://www.cadsoft.de/).
